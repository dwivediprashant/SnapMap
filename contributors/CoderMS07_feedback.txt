OpenCode Feedback – CoderMS07

This OpenCode edition was an amazing learning experience.
The competitive issues pushed me to think about UI quality, reusability,
and clean architecture rather than just "making it work".

Things I liked:
- Clear problem statements
- Active maintainers

Thank you for the opportunity.
Shit happens, keep pushing.
