Worked on a few UI fixes here — probably the most active repo in OpenCode. Great collaborating with you! Although I haven't contributed much as I'm still learning App Development, seeing the changes in the project and watching a real-world application unfold into production really helped me learn a lot. The project structure was great for a beginner to explore....

The resources on the discord channel helped a lot. Thanks for the opportunity and great experience.

Special Appreciation to Abdul_Azeem for maintaining the repo so well and showing great leadership skills.
